# sign-up-form

This project is all about forms. I don't see the exact use of forms right now, but I know that the knowledge will come in handy.
I am going to try and focus on getting the layout correct first, before I change the coloring.

I am als trying to recommit to using the readme files before and after a project to help document the journey.
